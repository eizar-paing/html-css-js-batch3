    <h1>Dog</h1>
    <p>The <b>dog</b> (<i><b>Canis familiaris</b></i><sup class="blue-text">[4][5]</sup> 
      or <i><b>Canis lupus familiaris</b></i><sup class="blue-text">[5]</sup>) is a 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domesticated">domesticated</a> 
      descendant of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolf">wolf</a>. 
      Also called the <b>domestic dog</b>, it is derived from extinct gray wolves,<sup class="blue-text">[6][7]</sup> 
      and the gray wolf is the dog's closest living relative.<sup class="blue-text">[8]</sup> 
      The dog was the first species to be domesticated<sup class="blue-text">[9][8]</sup> by humans. 
      Experts estimate that hunter-gatherers domesticated dogs more than 15,000 years ago in Oberkassel, 
      Bonn,<sup class="blue-text">[7]</sup> which was <mark style="background-color: rgb(40, 244, 40);">before the development of agriculture</mark>.
      <sup class="blue-text">[1]</sup> Due to their long association with humans, 
      dogs have expanded to a large number of domestic individuals<sup class="blue-text">[10]</sup> 
      and gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate 
      for other canids.<sup class="blue-text">[11]</sup>

      <dt><b>Domestication</b></dt>
      <dd>The earliest remains generally accepted to be those of a domesticated dog were discovered in Bonn-Oberkassel, Germany. Contextual, isotopic, genetic, 
        and morphological evidence shows that this dog was not a local wolf.<sup class="blue-text">[20]</sup></dd>
      <dt><b>Breeds</b></dt>
      <dd>Dogs are the most variable mammal on earth with around 450 globally recognized dog breeds.<sup class="blue-text">[10][25]</sup></dd>

    <h3>Range</h3>
    <hr>
    <p>As a domesticated or semi-domesticated animal, the dog is nearly universal among human societies. Notable exceptions once included:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Aboriginal Tasmanians, who were separated from Australia before the arrival of dingos on that continent</li>
      <li>The Andamanese peoples, who were isolated when rising sea levels covered the land bridge to Myanmar</li>
      <li>The Fuegians, who instead domesticated the Fuegian dog, a different canid species</li>
    </ul>
